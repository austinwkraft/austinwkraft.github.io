Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Austin, and I'm presently in Indonesia as a linguistics researcher. I study how languages encode structure and meaning, with a view toward community-focused design and stewardship of language technologies. (``What does all of that mean?'' I'll elaborate soon.) I hope to use this site to share updates on my projects and experiences. For more information about me and my work, visit the [About page](https://austinwkraft.github.io/about/).

This is a brief introduction, but I invite you to check back for more updates in the near future.
