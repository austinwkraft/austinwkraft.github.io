I am a linguistics researcher, currently affiliated with the American Indonesian Exchange Foundation and Unika Atma Jaya through a Fulbright U.S. Student Research Award. Broadly, I am interested in two related areas: (1) how sentence structure and meaning vary across different languages; and (2) how we can develop language technologies that dually enrich linguistic theory and align with communities' objectives.

More specifically, on (1): I am presently studying the syntax-semantics-pragmatics interface of anaphora. My studies on Austronesian anaphora have brought me to my current position in Indonesia as a researcher in Central Java and West Kalimantan. I previously researched the syntax of grammatical voice in East Javanese Indonesian. I have also conducted psycholinguistics research on various topics in syntax and semantics, particularly in projects on the real-time processing of covert *wh*-movement and filler-gap dependencies.

More specifically, on (2): I recognize a responsibility to grapple with questions about the privacy, autonomy, and social implications of language technologies. I have extensively written about and researched data privacy, from mathematical formalisms like differential privacy to emerging global legislation. I am interested in how linguistics fieldwork, corpus research, and industry applications can collect and process linguistic data in privacy-preserving ways. With more conscientious design of language technologies, linguistic theory and linguistic communities alike stand to benefit.

I earned dual degrees in linguistics and mathematics (specialization in computer applications), *summa cum laude*, from the University of Minnesota in 2020. I plan to pursue an advanced degree in 2023, following completion of my Fulbright grant period.
