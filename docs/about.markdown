I am a first-year MA student in linguistics at McGill University. Before moving to Montreal, I spent 2022-2023 in Indonesia on a Fulbright U.S. Student Research Award, advised by [Dr. Yanti](https://www.atmajaya.ac.id/en/pages/dosen-mltbi-5/). Broadly, I am interested in two related areas: (1) how sentence structure and meaning vary across different languages; and (2) how language documentation can advance speaker communities' interests alongside linguistic theory.

More specifically, on (1): I study argument structure, voice, and anaphora in languages of Indonesia. My Fulbright research documented patterns in anaphora in the Javanese spoken in Semarang and Pemalang, Central Java; and in a Land Dayak language called Simpakng spoken in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. I previously researched the syntax of voice in East Javanese Indonesian, advised by [Professor Hooi Ling Soh](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/sohxx001). I also conducted psycholinguistics research on long-distance syntactic processing, advised by [Professor Dustin Alfonso Chac√≥n](https://www.lingdustin.net/).

More specifically, on (2): I recognize a responsibility to grapple with questions about privacy, autonomy, and usability in language technologies. I am interested in how language documentation can yield usable corpora for speaker communities, particularly corpora in languages that are not extensively documented.

I earned dual bachelor's degrees in linguistics and mathematics (specialization in computer applications), *summa cum laude*, from the University of Minnesota in 2020.
